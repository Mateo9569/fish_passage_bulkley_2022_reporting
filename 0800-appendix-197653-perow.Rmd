## Site Location {.unnumbered}

PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` is located on
`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()` approximately 10km west of Topley, BC
within a small subdivision of residential properties. The site is
located on `r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name)`,
`r round(fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass(col_pull = downstream_route_measure)*0.001, 1)`km
upstream from the confluence with Byman Creek and approximately 50m
upstream of Highway 16. Byman Creek habitat and road stream crossing
structures were assessed in 2020 with background and results presented
in @irvine2021BulkleyRiver. Three stream crossing structures are located downstream of Perow Loop road and are discussed below.  Although modelling indicates seven crossings are located upstream of crossing 197653, review of GIS data indicates six of those crossings are located on small tributary streams over 7km upstream and very unlikely to provide high value habitat. The upstream crossing on the transmission line ~350m from Perow Loop road was assessed and is discussed below. Crossing `r as.character(my_site)` is the responsibility of the Ministry of
Transportation and Infrastructure.

## Background {.unnumbered}

At crossing `r as.character(my_site)`, `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()` is a
`r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass() %>% english::ordinal()` order stream with a
watershed area upstream of the crossing of approximately
`r fpr::fpr_my_wshd()`km^2^. The elevation of the watershed ranges from
a maximum of `r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_max')`m to
`r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_min')`m near the crossing (Table
\@ref(tab:tab-wshd-197653)). Although chinook, coho and steelhead have
been observed downstream in Byman Creek within \~100m of the crossing,
at the time of reporting, there was no fisheries information available
for the area upstream of crossing 197653 [@moe2020KnownBC;
@norris2020bcfishobs].  

<br>

```{r tab-wshd-197653, eval = T}
fpr::fpr_table_wshd_sum(site_id = my_site) %>% 
  fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = paste0('Summary of derived upstream watershed statistics for PSCIS crossing ', my_site, '.'),
           footnote_text = 'Elev P60 = Elevation at which 60% of the upstream watershed area is above',
           scroll = F)
```

<br>

PSCIS stream crossing `r as.character(my_site)` was ranked as a high
priority for follow up by the Canadian Wildlife Federation and a moderate priority for follow up by @irvine2021BulkleyRiver due to significant quantities of habitat
upstream modelled by `bcfishpass` as likely suitable for salmon rearing. A
total of `r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass(col_pull = total_lakereservoir_ha)`ha
of lake and `r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass(col_pull = total_wetland_ha)`ha of
wetland is modelled upstream and a summary of habitat modelling outputs
is presented in Table \@ref(tab:tab-culvert-bcfp-197653). A map of the
watershed is provided in map attachment
[`r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass(col_pull = dbm_mof_50k_grid)`](`r fpr::fpr_my_mapsheet()`).

## Stream Characteristics at Crossing {.unnumbered}

At the time of the survey, PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` was un-embedded,
non-backwatered and ranked as a
`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = barrier_result)` to upstream fish
passage according to the provincial protocol [@moe2011Fieldassessment]
(Table \@ref(tab:tab-culvert-197653)). The culvert outlet drop measured at
`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = outlet_drop_meters)`m high. There were large chunks of
concrete just downstream of the outlet armouring the
banks. There was no water at the time of survey.

## Stream Characteristics Downstream {.unnumbered}

`r fpr::fpr_my_survey_dist(loc = 'ds')` to the culvert (PSCIS 197657)
located on Highway 16, then an additional 25m downstream from the
highway.  The entire area assessed downstream of the crossing was dry at the time of the survey 
`r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-197653-01) - \\@ref(fig:photo-197653-02)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-197653-d01))."))`
`r fpr_my_cover_sentence(loc = 'ds')` The average channel width was `r fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = 'ds', col_pull = 'avg_channel_width_m')`m, and the average gradient was `r fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = 'ds', col_pull = 'average_gradient_percent')`%. `r fpr_my_substrate_sentence(loc = 'ds')` PSCIS crossing 197657 on the highway, approximately 50m
downstream from crossing 197653 was reassessed and ranked as passable as it was low gradient, fully embedded and with no outlet drop. It appeared passable to all species and life stages at the time of
assessment (Table \@ref(tab:tab-culvert-197657)). This crossing was previously assessed in 2020 by @irvine2021BulkleyRiver, but it was mistakenly input as modelled crossing ID 1800064, when it should have been 1800067. The stream from
`r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name)` to the highway flowed through private property and appeared to be
channelized and confined with concrete slabs used as stream bank armoring just downstream of the outlet. Downstream of the highway crossing two bridges are documented in the PSCIS database (197660 and 197659).  Although habitat downstream had limited complexity resulting from impacts related to the adjacent road infrastructure and residential properties, the habitat was rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'ds')` value as it was considered an important migration corridor.


<br>

```{r tab-culvert-197657, eval = T}

## Stream Characteristics Upstream {.unnumbered}

`r fpr_my_survey_dist(loc = 'us')`
`r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-197653-03) - \\@ref(fig:photo-197653-06)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-197653-d02))."))` Two sections of stream upstream of the crossing were assessed. As residential buildings and yards were situated immediately adjacent to the stream upstream of the crossing, the stream was accessed from a ford
located on the transmission line \~325m upstream of Perow Loop Road. The first section surveyed included 
\~350m of channel upstream of the ford and was dewatered at the time of
survey. `r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(loc = 'us')` 

<br>

Habitat quality improved significantly within the second section of stream surveyed where flows were significant. Water temperature was
`r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(col_pull = 'temperature_c')`$^\circ$C, pH
was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(col_pull = 'p_h')` and conductivity was
`r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(col_pull = 'conductivity_m_s_cm')`uS/cm. `r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(loc = 'us2')` There were gravels present throughout the area surveyed that were suitable for resident and anadromous salmonid spawning.
Infrequent deep pools for salmonids rearing and overwintering were also present. Overall, the
habitat was rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'us')` value as
an important migration corridor containing pockets of habitat suitable for spawning with moderate potential for juvenile salmonid rearing.

## Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate {.unnumbered}

Should restoration/maintenance activities proceed, replacement of PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` with a bridge (`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = recommended_diameter_or_span_meters)`m span) is recommended. The cost of the work is estimated at \$`r format(fpr::fpr_my_cost_estimate(), big.mark = ',')` for a cost benefit of `r fpr::fpr_my_cost_estimate(col_pull = cost_net)` linear m/\$1000 and `r fpr::fpr_my_cost_estimate(col_pull = cost_area_net)` m^2^/\$1000.

<br>

## Conclusion {.unnumbered}

There was
`r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(col_pull= upstream_habitat_length_km)`km of
habitat modelled upstream of crossing `r as.character(my_site)` with areas surveyed rated as
`r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(sit = my_site, loc = 'us', col_pull = hab_value)`
value for salmonid rearing and spawning. Crossing
`r as.character(my_site)` was ranked as a
`r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(col_pull = priority)` priority for
proceeding to design for replacement. Perow Creek near
crossing 197653 has been negatively impacted by adjacent land use related to landscaping of private
residences. Impacts include riparian vegetation removal, channelization, and streambank armouring. As there is no historic information on fish presence upstream of the highway fish sampling is recommended.  Regardless of whether structure replacement proceeds, local residents should be engaged to explore options for riparian and channel rehabilitation on private lands within the lower reaches.
