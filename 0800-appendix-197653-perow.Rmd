## Site Location {.unnumbered}

PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` is located on
`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()` approximately 10km west of Topley, BC.
PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` is located on
`r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name)`, approximately 500m upstream
from the confluence with the Bulkley River. Crossing 197653 is the
responsibility of the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure.

<br>

## Background {.unnumbered}

At crossing `r as.character(my_site)`, `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()` is a
`r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass() %>% english::ordinal()` order stream with a
watershed area upstream of the crossing of approximately
`r fpr::fpr_my_wshd()`km^2^. The elevation of the watershed ranges from
a maximum of `r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_max')`m to
`r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_site')`m at the crossing (Table
\@ref(tab:tab-wshd-197653)). Upstream of crossing
`r as.character(my_site)`, `r fpr::fpr_my_fish_sp()` have previously
been recorded upstream [@moe2020KnownBC; @norris2020bcfishobs].

<br>

```{r tab-wshd-197653, eval = T}
fpr::fpr_table_wshd_sum(site_id = my_site) %>% 
  fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = paste0('Summary of derived upstream watershed statistics for PSCIS crossing ', my_site, '.'),
           footnote_text = 'Elev P60 = Elevation at which 60% of the upstream watershed area is above',
           scroll = F)
```

<br>

PSCIS stream crossing `r as.character(my_site)` was ranked as a high
priority for follow up by Canadian Wildlife Federation because of
significant amounts of habitat modelled upstream of the crossing. A
total of `r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass(col_pull = total_lakereservoir_ha)`ha
of lake and `r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass(col_pull = total_wetland_ha)`ha of
wetland is modelled upstream and a summary of habitat modelling outputs
is presented in Table \@ref(tab:tab-culvert-bcfp-197653). A map of the
watershed is provided in map attachment
[`r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass(col_pull = dbm_mof_50k_grid)`](%60r%20fpr::fpr_my_mapsheet()%60).

## Stream Characteristics at Crossing {.unnumbered}

At the time of the survey, PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` was
non-backwatered and ranked as a
`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = barrier_result)` to upstream fish
passage according to the provincial protocol [@moe2011Fieldassessment]
(Table \@ref(tab:tab-culvert-197653)). Water temperature was
`r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(col_pull = 'temperature_c')`$^\circ$C, pH
was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(col_pull = 'p_h')` and conductivity was
`r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(col_pull = 'conductivity_m_s_cm')`uS/cm.

<br>

The outlet has large chunks of bedrock used for rip rap. There was no
water at the time of survey.

## Stream Characteristics Downstream {.unnumbered}

`r fpr::fpr_my_survey_dist(loc = 'ds')` to the culvert (PSCIS 197657)
located on Highway 16.
`r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-197653-01) - \\@ref(fig:photo-197653-02)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-197653-d01))."))`
`r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(loc = 'ds')` The stream from
`r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name)` to the highway is
channelized but it was completely dewatered at the time of survey. There
is bedrock just downstream of the outlet on both banks. The habitat was
rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'ds')` value for salmonid
rearing and spawning due to limited complexity resulting from adjacent
agricultural activities.

<br>

PSCIS crossing 197657 is located on the highway, approximately 50m from
crossing 197653. It was assessed and is fully embedded and appeared
passable to all species and life stages at the time of assessment (Table
\@ref(tab:tab-culvert-197657)).

```{r tab-culvert-197657, eval = T}

## Stream Characteristics Upstream {.unnumbered}

`r fpr_my_survey_dist(loc = 'us')`
`r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-197653-03) - \\@ref(fig:photo-197653-04)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-197653-d02))."))`
`r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(loc = 'us')` The survey started at a ford located on private land \~325m upstream of crossing 197653. The first \~350m of channel
upstream of the ford was dewatered at the time of survey. The habitat quality improves significantly once the water starts. Gravels present for resident and andronous salmonids. Infrequent deep pools for rearing and overwintering for salmonids. The
habitat was rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'us')` value as
an important migration corridor containing suitable spawning habitat and
having moderate rearing potential.

## Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate {.unnumbered}

## Conclusion {.unnumbered}

There was
`r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(col_pull= upstream_habitat_length_km)`km of
habitat modelled upstream of crossing `r as.character(my_site)` rated as
`r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(sit = my_site, loc = 'us', col_pull = hab_value)`
value for salmonid rearing and spawning. Crossing
`r as.character(my_site)` was ranked as a
`r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(col_pull = priority)` priority for
proceeding to design for replacement. The Perow Creek channel near crossing 197653 flows immediately adjacent to a number of private residences. Due to this developed land, surrounding Watershed health upstream and downstream of Perow Loop Rd is directly impacted. There are obvious signs of riparian degradation, channelization, and concrete riprap armouring. Should
structure replacement proceed follow up monitoring is recommended to
assess passability and utilization of the crossing by downstream fish
populations including coho who have been recorded in the upper Bulkley
River within 100m downstream of crossing `r as.character(my_site)`.
