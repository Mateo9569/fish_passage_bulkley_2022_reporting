1,Watson Creek,197974_ds,197974,ds,,2022-08-28,14:15,MW,350,medium,,,,,Medium value habitat. Low flow near culvert but as you get away (>50m) from it there's much better flow and habitat. Numerous deep pools and undercut banks. Not much cover in most areas. Abundant gravels suitable for spawning. Stream opens up after 100m and goes through cow pasture whre there's less cover and the stream becomes more coupled. 16:15

Trout backing? Concrete slabs on both banks us of bridge. Limited riparian veg due to farm. Not much overhead vegetation. Built up dams to form pools (livestock waterholes). Some garbage and debris in and around stream. Potential for higher value habitat but too much interference with property owners. Medium value habitat. 11:20
7,Stock Creek,195943_us,195943,us,,2022-08-30,11:32:40,AI,330,medium,high,7920,,, Medium value habitat. Good flow volume and decent amount of complexity due to boulders and undercut banks. Some small pockets of gravel suitable for resident rainbow spawning and potential coho.   Occasional shallow pools and traces of large water debris. Channel appears to be constricted due to agricultural development on both sides of the stream. Water withdrawal is occurring as well.  More agricultural development encroaching on the riparian farther upstream. Survey length 330 m. 11:32:40

Likely an important migration corridor, however the stream is heavily impacted by cattle chapel thanks and degradation related to cattle ranching And windthrow. Significant amounts of cattle manure in the stream likely putting water quality well above disgusting thresholds. Occasional pockets of gravel suitable for resident rainbow spawning. No fish observed. Boulders are the significant cover however there are just occasional pause with depth suitable for overwintering. Decent amount of hearing habitat for juveniles though.
