## Site Location {-}

PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` is located on `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()`, approximately 7km southeast of Topley, BC. PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` is located on `r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name)`.  Crossing `r as.character(my_site)` was located `r round(fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass(col_pull = downstream_route_measure)*0.001, 1)`km upstream from the confluence with the Bulkley River. Crossing `r as.character(my_site)` is the responsibility of the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure.

## Background {-}


At crossing `r as.character(my_site)`, `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()` is a `r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass() %>% english::ordinal()` order stream with a watershed area upstream of the crossing of approximately `r fpr::fpr_my_wshd()`km^2^. The elevation of the watershed ranges from a maximum of `r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_max')`m to `r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_min')`m near the crossing (Table \@ref(tab:tab-wshd-197974)). Upstream of crossing `r as.character(my_site)`, `r fpr::fpr_my_fish_sp()` have previously been recorded [@moe2020KnownBC; @norris2020bcfishobs].

```{r tab-wshd-197974, eval = T}
fpr::fpr_table_wshd_sum(site_id = my_site) %>% 
  fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = paste0('Summary of derived upstream watershed statistics for PSCIS crossing ', my_site, '.'),
           footnote_text = 'Elev P60 = Elevation at which 60% of the watershed area is above',
           scroll = F)

```

PSCIS stream crossing `r as.character(my_site)` was ranked as a high priority for follow up by the Canadian Wildlife Federation. A summary of habitat modelling outputs is presented in Table \@ref(tab:tab-culvert-bcfp-197974). A map of the watershed is provided in map attachment [`r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass(col_pull = dbm_mof_50k_grid)`](`r fpr::fpr_my_mapsheet()`).

## Stream Characteristics at Crossing {-}

At the time of the survey, PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` was un-embedded, non-backwatered and ranked as a `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = barrier_result) %>% stringr::str_to_lower()` to upstream fish passage according to the provincial protocol [@moe2011Fieldassessment] (Table \@ref(tab:tab-culvert-197974)). Water temperature was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(col_pull = 'temperature_c')`$^\circ$C, pH was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(col_pull = 'p_h')` and conductivity was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(col_pull = 'conductivity_m_s_cm')`uS/cm.

## Stream Characteristics Downstream {-}

`r fpr_my_survey_dist(loc = 'ds')` to the confluence with the Bulkley River
`r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-197974-01) - \\@ref(fig:photo-197974-02)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-197974-d01))."))`
`r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(loc = 'ds')` There's low flow near culvert but as you get away (>50m) from it there's much better flow and habitat. There are numerous deep pools and undercut banks but not much cover in most areas. Abundant gravels suitable for spawning. Stream opens up after 100m and goes through cow pasture where there's less cover and the stream becomes more coupled. The habitat was rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'ds')` value for salmonid rearing and spawning. 



## Stream Characteristics Upstream {-}


`r fpr_my_survey_dist(loc = 'us')`
`r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-197974-03) - \\@ref(fig:photo-197974-04)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-197974-d02))."))`
`r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(loc = 'ds')` Abundant gravels present for spawning. Lower 150-200m of stream is heavily impacted by cattle from Buckrow Angus farm. Beaver activity is present in lower section. There are numerous fry throughout. Some deep pools to 0.7m available for rearing and overwintering for rainbow fry and juvenile. Cattle are accessing the stream intermittently to the top of site.The habitat was rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'us')` value as an important migration corridor containing suitable spawning habitat and having moderate rearing potential.

<br>

## Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate {-}

Should restoration/maintenance activities proceed, replacement of PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` with a bridge (`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = recommended_diameter_or_span_meters)`m span) is recommended.   


<br>


## Conclusion {-}

There was `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(col_pull= upstream_habitat_length_km)`km of habitat modelled upstream of crossing `r as.character(my_site)` with areas surveyed rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(sit = my_site, loc = 'us', col_pull = hab_value)` value for salmonid rearing and spawning. Crossing `r as.character(my_site)` was ranked as a `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(col_pull = priority)` priority for proceeding to design for replacement.
