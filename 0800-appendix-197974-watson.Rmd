## Site Location {.unnumbered}

PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` is located under
`r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name)` on
`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()`, approximately 7km southeast of Topley, BC.
The highway is
`r round(fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass(col_pull = downstream_route_measure)*0.001, 1)`km
upstream from the confluence with the Bulkley River and the crossing is
the responsibility of the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure.

<br>

## Background {.unnumbered}

At crossing `r as.character(my_site)`, `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()` is a
`r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass() %>% english::ordinal()` order stream with a
watershed area upstream of the crossing of approximately
`r fpr::fpr_my_wshd()`km^2^. The elevation of the watershed ranges from
a maximum of `r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_max')`m to
`r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_site')`m at the crossing (Table
\@ref(tab:tab-wshd-197974)). Upstream of the highway
`r fpr::fpr_my_fish_sp()` have previously been recorded with the coho
observation date documented as September 2000 [@moe2020KnownBC;
@norris2020bcfishobs]. PSCIS crossing 198065 is located \~2.5km upstream
of the highway on Montgomery Road. The site was assessed in 2021 and was
ranked as a barrier to fish passage according to the provincial
protocol. Farther upstream, there are two addition site where GIS
modelling indicates road stream crossings may be present (modelled
crossing IDs 1801123 and 1801115). Watson Creek flows through Buckrow Angus farm immediately upstream of the highway then into Ailport Creek
approximately 350m downstream. Stream crossing structures
within Ailport Creek upstream of the confluence with Watson Creek were assessed in 2021 with
results presented in @irvine2022BulkleyRiver.

           scroll = F)

```

<br>

PSCIS stream crossing `r as.character(my_site)` was ranked as a high
priority for follow up by the Canadian Wildlife Federation and
@irvine2021BulkleyRiver due to significant quantities of habitat
upstream modelled by `bcfishpass` as likely suitable for salmon rearing.
A summary of habitat modelling outputs is presented in Table
\@ref(tab:tab-culvert-bcfp-197974) and a map of the watershed is
provided in map attachment
[`r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass(col_pull = dbm_mof_50k_grid)`](%60r%20fpr::fpr_my_mapsheet()%60).

## Stream Characteristics at Crossing {.unnumbered}

At the time of the survey, PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` was
un-embedded, non-backwatered and ranked as a
`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = barrier_result) %>% stringr::str_to_lower()`
to upstream fish passage according to the provincial protocol
[@moe2011Fieldassessment] (Table \@ref(tab:tab-culvert-197974)). The
culvert was considered a complete barrier to all species and all life
stages at all flows due to an outlet drop measured at
`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = outlet_drop_meters)`m high. The
deep and large outlet pool indicated that the culvert was significantly
undersized. Condition of the pipe was noted as poor with extensive
corrosion present and some collapsing in the middle of the pipe. Water
temperature was
`r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(col_pull = 'temperature_c')`$^\circ$C, pH
was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(col_pull = 'p_h')` and conductivity was
`r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(col_pull = 'conductivity_m_s_cm')`uS/cm.

## Stream Characteristics Downstream {.unnumbered}

`r fpr_my_survey_dist(loc = 'ds')` to the confluence with Ailport Creek
`r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-197974-01) - \\@ref(fig:photo-197974-02)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-197974-d01))."))`
`r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(loc = 'ds')` Immediately downstream of the
culvert stream flows were noted as very minimal however, at
approximately 50m downstream the volume of water increased
substantially. There were occasional deep pools and undercut banks but
cover and complexity was notably lacking in most areas. At approximately
100m downstream of the highway riparian forests have been removed to
accommodate pasture with notably less cover present and a channel confined by
steep banks. Abundant gravels suitable for resident and anadromous
salmonid spawning were present throughout the area surveyed. The habitat
was rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'ds')` value for
salmonid rearing and spawning.

## Stream Characteristics Upstream {.unnumbered}

`r fpr_my_survey_dist(loc = 'us')` `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-197974-03) - \\@ref(fig:photo-197974-04)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-197974-d02))."))`
`r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(loc = 'us')` Numerous salmonid fry were noted throughout the area surveyed along with abundant gravels suitable for resident and anadromous salmonid spawning. Immediately upstream of the crossing for approximately 150-200m stream banks and riparian areas were heavily impacted by cattle with beaver activity also noted in this area.  Some deep pools to 0.7m for
rearing and overwintering. Survey notes indicate that at the time of the survey cattle appeared to be
accessing the stream intermittently throughout the entire area surveyed.T Overall, the habitat surveyed upstream of the crossing
rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'us')` value as an important
migration corridor containing habitat suitable for spawning with moderate rearing potential.

## Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate {.unnumbered}

Should restoration/maintenance activities proceed, replacement of PSCIS
crossing `r as.character(my_site)` with a bridge
(`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = recommended_diameter_or_span_meters)`m
span) is recommended. 

<br>

## Conclusion {.unnumbered}

Modelling indicates 
`r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(col_pull= upstream_habitat_length_km)`km of
habitat upstream of crossing `r as.character(my_site)` suitable for steelhead rearing with
areas surveyed rated as
`r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(sit = my_site, loc = 'us', col_pull = hab_value)`
value for rearing and spawning. Crossing
`r as.character(my_site)` was ranked as a
`r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(col_pull = priority)` priority for
proceeding to design for replacement.  Capture of coho upstream of the highway in 2000 is an indication that the watershed has provided habitat for anadromous species in the past. Although the culvert under the highway appears to be a complete barrier to all species and life stages of fish at all flows, fish sampling in this area would help confirm that anadromous fish are no longer able to ascend the culvert.  This seems likely so it would be necessary to replace the highway crossing for anadromous fish to populate the watershed upstream.  Subsequently the highway crossing should be replaced first, before pursueing remedial works at the culvert located 2.5km upstream on Montgomery Road.
