## Site Location {.unnumbered}

PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` is located on
`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()`, in the town of New Hazelton, BC. PSCIS
crossing `r as.character(my_site)` is located on
`r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name)`. Waterfall Creek does not
have accurate modelling data in the `bcfishpass` database. Any modelling
included in this appendix was estimated using data collected in the
field and GIS data. Crossing `r as.character(my_site)` is located
approximately 4km upstream from the confluence with Station Creek.
Crossing `r as.character(my_site)` is the responsibility of the Ministry
of Transportation and Infrastructure.

<br>

## Background {.unnumbered}

At crossing `r as.character(my_site)`, `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()` is a
first order stream. Upstream of crossing `r as.character(my_site)`, cutthroat trout and dolly varden have previously been recorded
[@moe2020KnownBC; @norris2020bcfishobs].

<br>

Waterfall Creek is a primary tributary of the Station/Waterfall Creek
system. It's located in the community of New Hazelton and is thus
heavily impacted by urban and industrial development. A restoration
project was carried out along Waterfall Creek in 2001 by Nortec
Consulting. To help improve riparian vegetation, 300-400 seedlings were
planted within 5 m of the creek. General stream enhancement work
including the construction of walkways and bridges was also conducted
[@nortecconsulting2000]. In 1990, the Chicago Creek Community
Environmental Enhancement Society (CCES) developed a rehabilitation
project that aimed to reintroduce coho salmon to Waterfall Creek using
transplanted stocks from Toboggan Creek, near Smithers. After the
transplant license ended, the project had to rely on salmon returning to
the stream for brood stock to maintain population levels
[@houlden_donas2002ChicagoCreek]. Irvine (2021) conducted an assessment
on two crossings located on tributaries to Waterfall Creek.

<br>

Habitat assessments were conducted on a tributary to Waterfall Creek by
@irvine2022BulkleyRiver in 2021. Located upstream of PSCIS Crossing
198116, this tributary flows through New Hazelton and crosses the
highway. The highway crossing and a crossing further downstream were
assessed and both were deemed to be barriers at the time of survey,
according to provincial protocols. A detailed background and habitat
assessment can be found in the 2021 report
[here](https://www.newgraphenvironment.com/fish_passage_skeena_2021_reporting/station-creek---124420-124421-124422---appendix.html).

## Stream Characteristics at Crossing {.unnumbered}

At the time of the survey, PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` was
un-embedded, non-backwatered and ranked as a
`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = barrier_result) %>% stringr::str_to_lower()`
to upstream fish passage according to the provincial protocol
[@moe2011Fieldassessment] (Table \@ref(tab:tab-culvert-198116)). Water
temperature was
`r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(col_pull = 'temperature_c')`$^\circ$C, pH
was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(col_pull = 'p_h')` and conductivity was
`r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(col_pull = 'conductivity_m_s_cm')`uS/cm.

## Stream Characteristics Downstream {.unnumbered}

`r fpr_my_survey_dist(loc = 'ds')` to the confluence with the Bulkley
River
`r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-198116-01) - \\@ref(fig:photo-198116-02)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-198116-d01))."))`
`r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(loc = 'ds')` There is a culvert
approximately 100m upstream of PSCIS crossing 198116 that was also
assessed. At the time of survey, this crossing was un-embedded,
non-backwatered, and ranked as a barrier to upstream fish passage (Table
\@ref(tab:tab-culvert-2022091003)).The stream flows through the town of
New Hazelton. There was low flow at the time of survey and the stream
contained a lot of waste and debris. There was a lot of cover from
vegetation. The stream hits the railway and is drained into a tributary
that flows west until it joins Station Creek. The habitat was rated as
`r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'ds')` value for salmonid rearing and
spawning.

## Stream Characteristics Upstream {.unnumbered}

`r fpr_my_survey_dist(loc = 'us')`

`r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(loc = 'us')` There was a culvert
approximately 400m upstream of PSCIS crossing 198116 that was also
assessed. At the time of survey, this crossing was un-embedded,
non-backwatered, and ranked as a barrier to upstream fish passage (Table
\@ref(tab:tab-culvert-2022091001)). The habitat quality was excellent.
The stream flow was moderate and there were fish spotted all the way up
to the waterfall where the survey ended. There was an active minnow trap
found with many fish inside. There was plenty of cover from vegetation
and undercut banks. The habitat was rated as
`r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'us')` value as an important
migration corridor containing suitable spawning habitat and having
moderate rearing potential.

```{r tab-culvert-2022091001, eval = T}

## Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate {.unnumbered}

## Conclusion {.unnumbered}

There was 1.2km of
habitat modelled upstream of crossing `r as.character(my_site)` with
areas surveyed rated as
`r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(sit = my_site, loc = 'us', col_pull = hab_value)`
value for salmonid rearing and spawning. There is a large impassable waterfall at the end of survey that blocks fish passage for all life stages. Crossing
`r as.character(my_site)` was ranked as a
`r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(col_pull = priority)` priority for
proceeding to design for replacement.

The Waterfall Creek system is located directly in the community of New Hazelton. The stream is therefore significantly influenced by industrial and urban growth. There is a long history of community restoration and rehabilitation projects within the community. This crossing is an excellent candidate and should be replaced with an open bottom structure.
