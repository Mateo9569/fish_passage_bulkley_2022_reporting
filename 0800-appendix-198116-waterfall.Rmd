## Site Location {.unnumbered}

PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` is located on
`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()`, in the town of New Hazelton, BC. PSCIS
crossing `r as.character(my_site)` is located on
`r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name)`, and is approximately 4km upstream from the confluence with Station Creek. Waterfall Creek does not
have accurate modelling data in the `bcfishpass` database. Any modelling
included in this appendix was estimated using data collected in the
field along with GIS data. Three stream crossing structures are located upstream of the railway and are discussed below. These sites were prioritized after field reconnaissance indicated that Waterfall Creek was mapped incorrectly in the BC Freshwater Atlas stream network. PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site2)` is located on `r fpr_my_pscis_info(site = my_site2, col_pull = road_name)`, just downstream of 198116. PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site3)` is located on `r fpr_my_pscis_info(site = my_site3, col_pull = road_name)`, upstream of 198116. Crossing `r as.character(my_site)` is the responsibility of the Ministry
of Transportation and Infrastructure.

## Background {.unnumbered}

At crossing `r as.character(my_site)`, `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()` is a
first order stream. Upstream of crossing `r as.character(my_site)`, cutthroat trout and dolly varden have previously been recorded
[@moe2020KnownBC; @norris2020bcfishobs].  

<br>

Waterfall Creek is a primary tributary to Station Creek. Wilson and Rabnett (2007) reported that the crossing structure located on Highway 16 and Station Creek (PSCIS ID 124420) has been the subject of numerous assessments and designs with respect to the rehabilitation of fish passage. They ranked this crossing as having the highest priority for rehabilitation in the Bulkley River watershed. According to the Gitxsan Watershed Authority, Station Creek's mouth (Xsi Gwin Sagiiblax) was the location of a fishing site called Xsan Xsagiibil [@wilson_rabnett2007FishPassage]. @rabnett_williams2004Highway16 identified this area as having a high priority for additional assessments. To support rehabilitation efforts, @skrconsultantsltd_2006FishPassage carried out a thorough inspection, provided rehabilitation design options, and identified the natural limits of potential fish distribution. 

<br>

Habitat assessments were conducted downstream of the railway on Waterfall and Station Creek by
@irvine2022BulkleyRiver in 2021. Waterfall Creek flows through New Hazelton and crosses the railway downstream of PSCIS crossing 198117, then flowing under the highway. The highway crossing and a crossing further downstream were
assessed and both were deemed to be barriers at the time of survey,
according to provincial protocols. PSCIS crossing 124420 on Station Creek was re-assessed and ranked as a high priority for proceeding to design for replacement. A detailed background and habitat
assessment can be found in the 2021 report
[here](https://www.newgraphenvironment.com/fish_passage_skeena_2021_reporting/station-creek---124420-124421-124422---appendix.html).

<br>

Every year the Chicago Creek Community Environmental Enhancement Society carries out a trap and truck operation where coho are moved upstream of Highway 16 on Waterfall Creek from a fence erected up near the junction with the Bulkley River. Houlden, Houlden, and Donas (2001) reported that the incorrect installation of PSCIS crossing 124420 lead to coho stocks being wiped out in the system in the late 1970s. In order to return coho to the stream, the Waterfall Creek Stream Rehabilitation Project was started in 1990. Surplus stocks were moved from Toboggan Creek near Smithers. To help with the mission, the Hazelton Elementary Streamkeepers programme was established in 1993, and the Chicago Creek Community Environmental Enhancement Society was established in 1995 to build a hatchery close by. The hatchery is now shut down [@houlden_donas2002ChicagoCreek]. A restoration
project was carried out along Waterfall Creek in 2001 by Nortec
Consulting. To help improve riparian vegetation, 300-400 seedlings were
planted within 5 m of the creek. General stream enhancement work
including the construction of walkways and bridges was also conducted
[@nortecconsulting2000].

## Stream Characteristics at Crossing {.unnumbered}

At the time of the survey, PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` was
un-embedded, non-backwatered and ranked as a
`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = barrier_result) %>% stringr::str_to_lower()`
to upstream fish passage according to the provincial protocol
[@moe2011Fieldassessment] (Table \@ref(tab:tab-culvert-198116)). Water
temperature was
`r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(col_pull = 'temperature_c')`$^\circ$C, pH
was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(col_pull = 'p_h')` and conductivity was
`r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(col_pull = 'conductivity_m_s_cm')`uS/cm.

## Stream Characteristics Downstream {.unnumbered}

River

`r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(loc = 'ds')` There is a culvert
approximately 100m upstream of PSCIS crossing 198116 that was also
assessed. At the time of survey, this crossing was un-embedded,
non-backwatered, and ranked as a barrier to upstream fish passage (Table
\@ref(tab:tab-culvert-198117)).The stream flows through the town of
New Hazelton. There was low flow at the time of survey and the stream
contained a lot of waste and debris. There was a lot of cover from
vegetation. The stream hits the railway and is drained into a tributary
that flows west until it joins Station Creek. The habitat was rated as
`r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'ds')` value for salmonid rearing and
spawning.

`r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(loc = 'us')` There was a culvert
approximately 400m upstream of PSCIS crossing 198116 that was also
assessed. At the time of survey, this crossing was un-embedded,
non-backwatered, and ranked as a barrier to upstream fish passage (Table
\@ref(tab:tab-culvert-198115)). The habitat quality was excellent.
The stream flow was moderate and there were fish spotted all the way up
to the waterfall where the survey ended. An adult coho was seen upstream of crossing `r as.character(my_site2)`. There was plenty of cover from vegetation
and undercut banks. The habitat was rated as
`r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'us')` value as an important
migration corridor containing suitable spawning habitat and having
moderate rearing potential.

## Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate {.unnumbered}

## Conclusion {.unnumbered}

There was 1.2km of
habitat modelled upstream of crossing `r as.character(my_site)` with
areas surveyed rated as
`r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(sit = my_site, loc = 'us', col_pull = hab_value)`
value for salmonid rearing and spawning. There is a large impassable waterfall at the end of survey that blocks fish passage for all life stages. Crossing
`r as.character(my_site)` was ranked as a
`r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(col_pull = priority)` priority for
proceeding to design for replacement.

The Waterfall Creek system is located directly in the community of New Hazelton and is thus
heavily impacted by urban and industrial development. There is a long history of community restoration and rehabilitation projects within the community. This crossing is an excellent candidate and should be replaced with an open bottom structure.
