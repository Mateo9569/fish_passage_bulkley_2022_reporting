## Site Location {-}

PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` is located approximately 12km north west of Houston, BC. The site is located on
`r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name)`, approximately `r round(fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass(col_pull = downstream_route_measure)*0.001, 1)`km upstream from the confluence with the Bulkley River. PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site2)` is located on Highway 16, approximately 850m upstream of crossing 195943. Both crossings are the responsibility of the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure.

<br>

## Background {-}

At crossing `r as.character(my_site)`, `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()` is a
`r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass() %>% english::ordinal()` order stream with a
watershed area upstream of the crossing of approximately
`r fpr::fpr_my_wshd()`km^2^. The elevation of the watershed ranges from
a maximum of `r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_max')`m to `r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_site')`m at the
crossing (Table \@ref(tab:tab-wshd-195943)). Although coho and chinook salmon have been observed just downstream of the railway crossing in the past, there is no fisheries information within provincial databases for the areas upstream of crossings 195943 and 195944 [@knowledgemanagement2022KnownBC; @norris2022smnorrisbcfishobs]. At the time of reporting, Harry Bell owned land adjacent to the creek near the highway and `r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name)`. He reported historical sightings of adult coho and steelhead upstream of `r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name)`. A railway crossing (PSCIS 198112) is located approximately 2km downstream of crossing `r as.character(my_site)`.

At the time of reporting, Dogwood Environmental Consulting (Dogwood) were working on a grazing/fuel reduction pilot project in collaboration with BC Wildfire, the Ministry of Agriculture and BC Cattlemanâ€™s Association.  The purpose of the work is to reduce fuel load on  crown/agricultural land interface and enhance grazing land through targeted grazing and/or through the manual removal of dead standing timber and coarse woody debris. At the time of reporting, Stock Creek, upstream of the assessed Highway 16 crossing, was included within the project area and Dogwood noted that they hoped to help range holders mitigate some of the potential impacts related to fuel reduction opening up access to streams by exploring opportunities to prevent cattle from accessing riparian buffers (pers. comm Jenn Atkins, 2022).

PSCIS stream crossings `r as.character(my_site)` and `r as.character(my_site2)` were ranked as high priorities for follow up by Canadian Wildlife Federation due to
significant amounts of habitat modelled as upstream of the crossing. Following a review of PSCIS database and modelling outputs @irvine2018AnalysisPriority ranked both crossings as moderate priorities for follow up with habitat confirmations with notes that the stream appeared to be dewatered at both locations in the PSCIS database photos and because the watershed was relatively low in elevation. A total of
`r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass(col_pull = total_lakereservoir_ha)`ha of lake
and `r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass(col_pull = total_wetland_ha)`ha of wetland
is modelled upstream and a summary of habitat modelling outputs is
presented in Table \@ref(tab:tab-culvert-bcfp-195943). A map of the
watershed is provided in map attachment
[`r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass(col_pull = dbm_mof_50k_grid)`](`r fpr::fpr_my_mapsheet()`).

## Stream Characteristics at Crossings {.unnumbered}

At the time of the survey, PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` was un-embedded, 
non-backwatered and ranked as a
`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = barrier_result)` to upstream fish
passage according to the provincial protocol [@moe2011Fieldassessment]
(Table \@ref(tab:tab-culvert-195943)). The culvert outlet drop was significant at 1.1m. Water temperature was
`r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(col_pull = 'temperature_c')`$^\circ$C, pH
was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(col_pull = 'p_h')` and conductivity was
`r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(col_pull = 'conductivity_m_s_cm')`uS/cm. A
beaver dam was noted just upstream of the culvert inlet (\~1.5m high).

PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site2)` was un-embedded, 
non-backwatered and ranked as a
`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = barrier_result)` to upstream fish
passage. The culvert length and fill depth were estimated at 167m and 35m, respectively (Table \@ref(tab:tab-culvert-195944)).

## Stream Characteristics Downstream of `r as.character(my_site)` {.unnumbered}

`r fpr::fpr_my_survey_dist(loc = 'ds')`.
`r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-195943-01) - \\@ref(fig:photo-195943-02)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-195943-d01))."))`
`r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(loc = 'ds')` There was a pool approximately 180m downstream of the crossing where multiple fish up to 10cm in length were spotted. A footbridge was found 20m past this pool. Concrete slabs were located on both banks upstream of the bridge. The stream had minimal overhanging and riparian vegetation due to farmland. Some areas had built up dams that formed pools. These are likely being used as livestock waterholes. Some garbage and debris was found in and around the stream. The habitat was
rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'ds')` value for salmonid
rearing and spawning. There is potential for higher value habitat but there is limited complexity due to adjacent
agricultural activities. 

<br>

PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site3)` located further downstream on the CN Railway was assessed and ranked as passable to all species and life stages at the time of survey. The crossing was embedded and fully backwatered (Table
\@ref(tab:tab-culvert-1805507)).

## Stream Characteristics Upstream of `r as.character(my_site)` and Downstream of `r as.character(my_site2)` {-}

`r fpr_my_survey_dist(loc = 'us')` and downstream of `r as.character(my_site2)` for an additional `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(sit = my_site2, loc = 'ds', col_pull = 'length_surveyed')`
`r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-195943-03) - \\@ref(fig:photo-195943-04)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-195943-d02))."))`  
Within the site immediately upstream of `r as.character(my_site)` `r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(loc = 'us')` Good flow volumes were noted along with a decent amount of complexity due to boulders and undercut banks. There were small pockets of gravel suitable for resident rainbow as well as coho and steelhead spawning. The channel appeared to be constricted with riparian vegetation removed on both sides of the stream, likely due to agricultural development. Irrigation pipes in the channel indicated water withdrawal was occurring. The
habitat was rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'us')` value as
an important migration corridor containing suitable spawning habitat and
having moderate rearing potential for juvenile coho, steelhead and other salmonids.

<br>

Within the site surveyed immediately downstream of the highway,  
`fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(sit = my_site2, loc = 'ds')`  There were many undercut banks throughout, with fish up tp 20cm long sighted throughout covered areas. There was a cattle trail next to the stream, with areas of erosion and minimal quantities of gravel suitable for spawning. Although riparian vegetation in the upper portions of the area surveyed 
habitat was rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'ds', sit = my_site2)` value as
an important migration corridor containing some suitable spawning habitat and
having moderate rearing potential.

<br>

## Stream Characteristics Upstream of `r as.character(my_site2)` {-}

`r fpr_my_survey_dist(loc = 'us', sit = my_site2)`
`r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-195944-05) - \\@ref(fig:photo-195944-06)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-195944-d02))."))` `r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(loc = 'us', sit = my_site2)` Within the areas surveyed, the stream was noted heavily impacted by cattle activity with significant amounts of manure in the stream, degraded/removed riparian vegetation and extensive areas of trampled banks. There were occasional pockets of gravel suitable for resident rainbow spawning. Field notes indicate, occasional pools with depths suitable for juvenile salmon and adult resident salmonid overwintering. A rock drop of 65cm was located 365m upstream of the top end of the culvert. 


## Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate {-}

Should restoration/maintenance activities proceed, replacement of PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` with a bridge (`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = recommended_diameter_or_span_meters)`m span) is recommended. The cost of the work is estimated at \$`r format(fpr::fpr_my_cost_estimate(), big.mark = ',')` for a cost benefit of `r fpr::fpr_my_cost_estimate(col_pull = cost_net)` linear m/\$1000 and `r fpr::fpr_my_cost_estimate(col_pull = cost_area_net)` m^2^/\$1000.

<br>

## Conclusion {-}

There was
`r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(col_pull= upstream_habitat_length_km)`km of
habitat modelled upstream of crossing `r as.character(my_site)` rated as
`r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(sit = my_site, loc = 'us', col_pull = hab_value)`
value for salmonid rearing and spawning. Crossing
`r as.character(my_site)` was ranked as a
`r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(col_pull = priority)` priority for
proceeding to design for replacement with a bridge.

At the time of assessment Stock Creek was heavily impacted by land clearing and cattle throughout the areas surveyed. However, habitat present provided habitat suitable for juvenile coho, steelhead and resident salmonids with fish observed during field assessments. Although
