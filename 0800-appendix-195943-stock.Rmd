## Site Location {-}

PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` is located approximately 12km north west of Houston, BC. The site is located on
`r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name)`, approximately `r round(fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass(col_pull = downstream_route_measure)*0.001, 1)`km upstream from the confluence with the Bulkley River. PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site2)` is located on Highway 16, approximately 850m upstream of crossing 195943. Both crossings are the responsibility of the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure.

<br>

## Background {-}

At crossing `r as.character(my_site)`, `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()` is a
`r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass() %>% english::ordinal()` order stream with a
watershed area upstream of the crossing of approximately
`r fpr::fpr_my_wshd()`km^2^. The elevation of the watershed ranges from
a maximum of `r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_max')`m to `r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_site')`m at the
crossing (Table \@ref(tab:tab-wshd-195943)). Although coho and chinook salmon have been observed just downstream of the railway crossing in the past, there is no fisheries information within provincial databases for the areas upstream of crossings 195943 and 195944 [@knowledgemanagement2022KnownBC; @norris2022smnorrisbcfishobs]. At the time of reporting, Harry Bell owned land adjacent to the creek near the highway and `r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name)`. He reported historical sightings of adult coho and steelhead upstream of `r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name)`. A railway crossing (PSCIS 198112) is located approximately 2km downstream of crossing `r as.character(my_site)`.

           footnote_text = 'Elev P60 = Elevation at which 60% of the upstream watershed area is above',
           scroll = F)
```

<br>

At the time of reporting, Dogwood Environmental Consulting were working on a grazing/fuel reduction pilot project in collaboration with BC Wildfire, the Ministry of Agriculture and BC Cattlemanâ€™s Association.  The purpose of the work is to reduce fuel load on  crown/agricultural land interface and enhance grazing land through targeted grazing and/or through the manual removal of dead standing timber and coarse woody debris. At the time of reporting, Stock Creek, upstream of the assessed Highway 16 crossing, was included within the project area and Dogwood Environmental Consulting noted that they hoped to help range holders mitigate some of the potential impacts related to fuel reduction opening up access to streams by exploring opportunities to prevent cattle from accessing riparian buffers (pers. comm Jenn Atkins, 2022). 

<br>

PSCIS stream crossings `r as.character(my_site)` and `r as.character(my_site2)` were ranked as high priorities for follow up by Canadian Wildlife Federation due to
significant amounts of habitat modelled as upstream of the crossing. Following a review of PSCIS database and modelling outputs @irvine2018AnalysisPriority ranked both crossings as moderate priorities for follow up with habitat confirmations with notes that the stream appeared to be dewatered at both locations in the PSCIS database photos and because the watershed was relatively low in elevation. A total of
`r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass(col_pull = total_lakereservoir_ha)`ha of lake
and `r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass(col_pull = total_wetland_ha)`ha of wetland
is modelled upstream and a summary of habitat modelling outputs is
presented in Table \@ref(tab:tab-culvert-bcfp-195943). A map of the
watershed is provided in map attachment
[`r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass(col_pull = dbm_mof_50k_grid)`](`r fpr::fpr_my_mapsheet()`).

## Stream Characteristics at Crossings {.unnumbered}

At the time of the survey, PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` was un-embedded, 
non-backwatered, had a culvert outlet drop of `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = outlet_drop_meters)`m and ranked as a
`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = barrier_result)` to upstream fish
passage according to the provincial protocol [@moe2011Fieldassessment]
(Table \@ref(tab:tab-culvert-195943)).  Water temperature was
`r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(col_pull = 'temperature_c')`$^\circ$C, pH
was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(col_pull = 'p_h')` and conductivity was
`r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(col_pull = 'conductivity_m_s_cm')`uS/cm.

<br>

PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site2)` was un-embedded, 
non-backwatered and ranked as a
`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = barrier_result)` to upstream fish
passage. The culvert length was 167m, the fill depth was estimated at 35m and the outlet drop was measured at `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(site = my_site2, col_pull = outlet_drop_meters)`m (Table \@ref(tab:tab-culvert-195944)).

## Stream Characteristics Downstream of `r as.character(my_site)` {.unnumbered}

`r fpr::fpr_my_survey_dist(loc = 'ds')`
`r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-195943-01) - \\@ref(fig:photo-195943-02)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-195943-d01))."))`
`r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(loc = 'ds')` A footbridge was present approximately 200m downstream with concrete slabs on both adjacent banks upstream.  Multiple fish up to 10cm in length were observed in a pool near the bridge.  The stream had minimal overhanging and riparian vegetation in the area surveyed due to adjacent agricultural use. Some areas of stream had pools formed by small dams likely built for livestock waterholes. The habitat was rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'ds')` value for salmonid rearing and spawning. 

<br>

PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site3)` located aproximatley 600 downstream of `r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name)` on the CN Railway was assessed and ranked as passable to all species and life stages at the time of survey. The crossing was embedded and fully backwatered (Table \@ref(tab:tab-culvert-1805507)).  Adjacent of the crossing the area was beaver influenced wetland habitat.

<br>

```{r tab-culvert-1805507, eval = T}

## Stream Characteristics Upstream of `r as.character(my_site)` and Downstream of `r as.character(my_site2)` {-}

`r fpr_my_survey_dist(loc = 'us')`
`r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-195943-03) - \\@ref(fig:photo-195943-04)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-195943-d02))."))`  
`r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(loc = 'us')` Good flow volumes were noted along with a decent amount of complexity due to boulders and undercut banks. There were small pockets of gravel suitable for resident rainbow as well as coho and steelhead spawning. The channel appeared to be constricted with riparian vegetation removed on both sides of the stream, likely due to agricultural development. Irrigation pipes in the channel indicated water withdrawal was occurring. The
habitat was rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'us')` value as
an important migration corridor containing suitable spawning habitat and
having moderate rearing potential for juvenile coho, steelhead and other salmonids.

<br>

The stream was surveyed downstream from crossing `r as.character(my_site2)` for `r fpr_my_priority_info(sit = my_site2, loc = 'ds', col_pull = 'length_surveyed')`m. `r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(sit = my_site2, loc = 'ds')` There were many undercut banks throughout, with fish up to 20cm long sighted throughout covered areas. There was a cattle trail next to the stream, with significan areas of streambank impacted by erosion.  Minimal quantities of gravel suitable for spawning were observed. Although riparian vegetation in the upper portions of the area surveyed 
habitat was rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'ds', sit = my_site2)` value as
an with occasional pockets of habitat suitable for resident/anadromous salmonid spawning and
moderate rearing potential for juvenile salmonids.

<br>

## Stream Characteristics Upstream of `r as.character(my_site2)` {-}

`r fpr_my_survey_dist(loc = 'us', sit = my_site2)`
`r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-195944-05)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-195944-d03))."))` `r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(loc = 'us', sit = my_site2)` Within the areas surveyed, the stream was noted as heavily impacted by cattle activity with significant amounts of manure in the stream, degraded/removed riparian vegetation and extensive areas of trampled banks. There were occasional pockets of gravel suitable for resident rainbow spawning. Field notes indicate, occasional pools with depths suitable for juvenile salmon and adult resident salmonid overwintering. A rock drop of 65cm was located 365m upstream of the top end of the culvert `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-195944-06)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-195944-d03))."))` This drop would likely be passable for adult salmonids but dependent on flow conditions, could prevent upstream migration for for younger life stages of anadromous fish as well as non-adult resident species.


## Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate {-}

Replacement of PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` with a bridge (`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = recommended_diameter_or_span_meters)`m span) is recommended. The cost of the work was estimated at \$`r format(fpr::fpr_my_cost_estimate(), big.mark = ',')` for a cost benefit of `r fpr::fpr_my_cost_estimate(col_pull = cost_net)` linear m/\$1000 and `r fpr::fpr_my_cost_estimate(col_pull = cost_area_net)` m^2^/\$1000. Replacement of PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site2)` with a bridge (`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = recommended_diameter_or_span_meters)`m span) will have significant costs (\$`r format(fpr::fpr_my_cost_estimate(site = my_site2), big.mark = ',')`) due to the length of the structure and depth of fill.  A cost benefit is estimated `r fpr::fpr_my_cost_estimate(site = my_site2, col_pull = cost_net)` linear m/\$1000 and `r fpr::fpr_my_cost_estimate(site = my_site2, col_pull = cost_area_net)` m^2^/\$1000.

<br>

## Conclusion {-}

Crossing `r as.character(my_site)` was ranked as a `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(col_pull = priority)` priority for
proceeding to design for replacement with a bridge with `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(col_pull= upstream_habitat_length_km)`km of habitat present upstream before the highway 16 crossing rated as
`r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(sit = my_site, loc = 'us', col_pull = hab_value)`
value for resident rainbow, coho and steelhead rearing and spawning. Crossing `r as.character(my_site2)` was ranked as a `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(col_pull = priority)` priority for
proceeding to design for replacement with a bridge with `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(sit = my_site2, col_pull= upstream_habitat_length_km)`km of habitat modelled as present upstream. Heavily impacted by range use, the habitat surveyed upstream of this culvert was rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(sit = my_site, loc = 'us', col_pull = hab_value)` value.

<br>

At the time of assessment, Stock Creek was heavily impacted by land clearing and cattle throughout all areas surveyed due to trampled banks and grazed or removed riparian vegetation. It is encouraging that range holders, the province and consultants (ie. Dogwood Environmental Consulting) hope to mitigate some of the potential impacts related to fuel reduction work ongoing at the time of reporting by exploring opportunities to prevent cattle from accessing riparian buffers. It is recommended that an overall plan also be developed to restore the riparian areas and further mitigate range use impacts on stream health. Historic information from the site indicate that flows can be minimal during dry periods. An analysis of land cover and water withdrawal for the greater watershed could provide valuable information as to inform restoration planning such as potentially reversible land use impacts that may exacerbate drought (ex. historic wetland drainage, multiple points of water diversion, vegetation removal, etc).  Historical sightings of adult coho and steelhead upstream of Barrett Station Road by the landowner adjacent to crossing `r as.character(my_site)` indicate that the stream was historically suitable for these species and the lower reaches' location near the Bulkley River mainsten position it for likely utilization by numerous fish species when flows are adequate.  These insights and the large size of the outlet drop from the pipe under `r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name)` position this site as A good candidate for fish passage restoration.
