## Site Location {.unnumbered}

PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` is located on
`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()`, approximately 30km north west of Houston,
BC. The site is located on `r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name)`.
Crossing `r as.character(my_site)` was located
`r round(fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass(col_pull = downstream_route_measure)*0.001, 1)`km
upstream from the confluence with the Bulkley River. Crossing
`r as.character(my_site)` is the responsibility of the Ministry of
Transportation and Infrastructure.

<br>

## Background {.unnumbered}

At crossing `r as.character(my_site)`, `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()` is a
`r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass() %>% english::ordinal()` order stream with a
watershed area upstream of the crossing of approximately
`r fpr::fpr_my_wshd()`km^2^. The elevation of the watershed ranges from
a maximum of `r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_max')`m to
`r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_min')`m near the crossing (Table
\@ref(tab:tab-wshd-57793)). Upstream of crossing
`r as.character(my_site)`, `r fpr::fpr_my_fish_sp()` have previously
been recorded [@moe2020KnownBC; @norris2020bcfishobs].

<br>

```{r tab-wshd-57793, eval = T}
fpr::fpr_table_wshd_sum(site_id = my_site) %>% 
  fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = paste0('Summary of derived upstream watershed statistics for PSCIS crossing ', my_site, '.'),
           footnote_text = 'Elev P60 = Elevation at which 60% of the watershed area is above',
           scroll = F)

```

<br>

Vallee Lake is
`r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass(site = my_site, col_pull = total_lakereservoir_ha)`ha
in size and modelling indicates an additional
`r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass(col_pull = total_wetland_ha)`ha of wetland
upstream of the highway. Large lakes within watersheds can throttle high
freshet and storm flows, increasing stability downstream for egg
incubation and juvenile rearing.

<br>

Further downstream, GIS modelling indicates there is one crossing (modelled crossing ID 1802482) before the confluence of the Bulkley River. However, local knowledge from a landowner revealed that the crossing was no longer present. Upstream of crossing 57793, review of GIS indicates there are three crossings located on the mainstem of Vallee Creek, along with several modelled crossings on tributaries that are likely very small. PSCIS crossing 57801 is located past Vallee Lake on Highway 16 and was listed as a barrier at the time of survey by @gollner2013 in 2012. 

<br>

PSCIS stream crossing `r as.character(my_site)` was ranked as a high
priority for follow up by the Canadian Wildlife Federation due to
significant amounts of habitat modeled upstream.
@irvine2018AnalysisPriority ranked the site as a moderate priority for
follow up after review of PSCIS data/photos because the site appeared to
have low flows, be partially backwatered and have no outlet drop
indicating it was likely passable to most species and life stages at the
time the initial fish passage assessment was conducted by @gollner2013
in 2012. A summary of habitat modelling outputs is presented in Table
\@ref(tab:tab-culvert-bcfp-57793). A map of the watershed is provided in
map attachment
[`r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass(col_pull = dbm_mof_50k_grid)`](%60r%20fpr::fpr_my_mapsheet()%60).

## Stream Characteristics at Crossing {.unnumbered}

At the time of the survey, PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` was
un-embedded, non-backwatered and ranked as a
`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = barrier_result) %>% stringr::str_to_lower()`
barrier to upstream fish passage according to the provincial protocol
[@moe2011Fieldassessment] (Table \@ref(tab:tab-culvert-57793)). There
was low flow through the culvert at the time of survey. However, a deep
outlet pool was present indicating high flows do occur and that the
culvert may be undersized. Water temperature was
`r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = "ds", col_pull = 'temperature_c')`$^\circ$C,
pH was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = "ds", col_pull = 'p_h')` and
conductivity was
`r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = "ds", col_pull = 'conductivity_m_s_cm')`uS/cm.

## Stream Characteristics Downstream {.unnumbered}

`r fpr_my_survey_dist(loc = 'ds')` to the confluence with the Bulkley
River
`r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-57793-01) - \\@ref(fig:photo-57793-02)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-57793-d01))."))`
`r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(loc = 'ds')` There were undercut banks and
abundant riparian vegetation throughout providing good cover for fish.
Some gravels were present that could be suitable for spawning.
Functional large woody debris was present throughout the stream.The
habitat was rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'ds')` value for
salmonid rearing and spawning.

## Stream Characteristics Upstream {.unnumbered}

`r fpr_my_survey_dist(loc = 'us')`
`r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-57793-03) - \\@ref(fig:photo-57793-06)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-57793-d02))."))`
`r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(loc = 'us')` The data for the upstream
survey was misplaced and stream characteristics and measurements were
obtained by reviewing photos. The habitat quality was excellent. There
were abundant undercut banks and healthy mixed riparian vegetation
throughout. The stream was wide and contained some pockets of gravel
suitable for spawning resident species. The habitat was rated as
`r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'us')` value as an important
migration corridor containing suitable spawning habitat and having
moderate rearing potential.

## Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate {.unnumbered}

Should restoration/maintenance activities proceed, replacement of PSCIS
crossing `r as.character(my_site)` with a bridge
(`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = recommended_diameter_or_span_meters)`m
span) is recommended. The cost of the work is estimated at
\$`r format(fpr::fpr_my_cost_estimate(), big.mark = ',')` for a cost
benefit of `r fpr::fpr_my_cost_estimate(col_pull = cost_net)` linear
m/\$1000 and `r fpr::fpr_my_cost_estimate(col_pull = cost_area_net)`
m^2^/\$1000.

## Conclusion {.unnumbered}

There was
`r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(col_pull= upstream_habitat_length_km)`km of
habitat modelled upstream of crossing `r as.character(my_site)` with
areas surveyed rated as
`r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(sit = my_site, loc = 'us', col_pull = hab_value)`
value for salmonid rearing and spawning. Crossing
`r as.character(my_site)` was ranked as a
`r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(col_pull = priority)` priority for
proceeding to design for replacement. There was a very small outlet drop
at the time of survey and the low elevation of the watershed results in
very low flows in typical years. Evidence of low flows is shown
[here](https://a100.gov.bc.ca/pub/pscismap/imageViewer.do?assessmentId=57833)
in photos taken from the assessment done by @gollner2013 in
2012. However, fish sampling upstream and downstream of the culvert is
recommended in the future as it will provide insight into fish community
composition and density. This information will be key in determining the
biological value of remediating the site.
